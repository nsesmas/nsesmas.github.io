            <h3>An Afternoon at the Library, Digital Image, 2019</h3>
            <p>The concept for this collaborative piece was to create a composite image that has to do with a place. The size of our image is what is unifying , 11x14. I devided to work from an image that I took myself at the Huntington Library in Los Angeles. I wanted to create a hyper reality that would take place at the library on a Sunday afternoon. I wanted to blend the fine art style that the library has and the community that surrounds LA. I want it to be a relaxed fun afternoon that turns into an outdoor party. I want the viewer to have to take their time and reallt look at the small details of the image rather than it be something that is obvious. </p>

      <h3>Nostalgic Dreams, Audio/Video, 2019</h3>
      <p>The concept for Nostalgic Dreams was about coming to terms with my OCD tendencies. I tend to replay moments in my mind constantly throughout my days and this video.audio I created represent these thoughts and emotions.</p>

    <h3>Queer Pool, Net Art, 2019</h3>
    <p>This collaborative piece's concept was inspired by the Yahoo Pool game of the early 2000s. We customized it to make it relevant to our identities and community. We envisioned Queer Pool a place where friendships could be built. It serves as one of our early internet memories and a fictional chatroom.</p>

      <h3>Untitled 1, 2, 3, GIF, 2019</h3>
    <p>This series are gifs with incorporated glitches. This work creates disruption in the movement and repetition of light. The work is meant to create distortion in commonly known arcade games which gives the viewers a skewed view of the subjects.</p>
